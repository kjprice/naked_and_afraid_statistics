# naked_and_afraid_statistics
Statistics from each episode of the popular reality tv show "Naked And Afraid"

Note that the data was originally compiled by Mark Biegert and made availale via [mathscinotes.com](https://www.mathscinotes.com/2016/04/naked-and-afraid-statistics/). Huge amount of effort went in to getting this dataset started and the site provides incredible insights into various domains.

However, future effort seemed to have paused to continue the dataset. I wanted to make a subset of the information available so that others can collaborate on extending the dataset.
